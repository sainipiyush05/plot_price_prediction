## ⚙️ How It Works  

📌 **Step 1: Data Collection**  
- The dataset contains information on various plots, including features like location, size, and amenities.  

📌 **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**  
- Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.  

📌 **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzes data distributions and relationships between features to gain insights.  

📌 **Step 4: Model Training**  
- Applies machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict plot prices.  

📌 **Step 5: Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² score.  

📌 **Step 6: Visualization**  
- Visualizes the comparison between predicted and actual plot prices to assess model accuracy.
